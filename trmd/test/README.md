# WAC.Tax

Declare change and create the future!

[WAC](https://wac.tax) , the full name is `Web & Api Components` , is an exciting plugin base for frontend and backend components, hoping to reshape the future of the Internet.

Based on the plugin base, we will gradually implement various infrastructure components, such as: user system, billing system, payment system, etc.

This is just a small step of our dream, and the bigger vision is - to create an open component market, where developers can freely sell component applications and unleash unlimited potential.

## What's this?

According to the report of [w3techs.com](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) , 43.2% of the websites on the Internet use Wordpress.

Wordpress can achieve such success, I believe it is inseparable from its ecologically rich plug-in system.

However, Wordpress can usually only be used on stand-alone websites, and it is difficult to be embedded in self-developed website applications as functional modules.

After all, the original intention of Wordpress is to become a blogging system, not a plug-in base for front-end and back-end components.

WAC.Tax wants to be the WordPress of components.

As a developer of a self-developed website, I often come into contact with embeddable subsystems such as [auth0 authentication](https://auth0.com) , [disqus comment system](https://disqus.com) , [algolia website search](https://www.algolia.com) , [intercom online customer service](https://www.intercom.com) , [square online payment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/overview) , etc. components.

However, these existing component systems are independent, fragmented, and isolated from each other.

This creates a problem, you have to register a bunch of accounts and log in to their respective admin backgrounds to manage them.

Yes, they only componentize some functions, but the management background does not.

It may be nothing for ordinary websites, but if your product is to sell SaaS to third parties, you definitely hope that various functions can have a unified management background on the site, rather than a third-party website that is all over the place—— Looks very unprofessional.

For many SaaS companies with high market capitalization, their focus is no longer on research and development of products, but on continuous mergers and acquisitions, and then integrate functions into a unified system, and then grow through joint sales. They evolved from single products to platforms.

And WAC.Tax allows all functions to be independent page components (including the management background), which can be easily integrated into your self-developed system, so that the one-stop experience is no longer monopolized by large platform-level companies, allowing small The R&D team can also become a platform.

Let's declare change and create the future together!
